# Reddit, but it's all cats!
## React/Redux project developed by Mikayla Dobson

This project was completed as a portfolio project in Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Pro course!

The goal of this project was to build a read-only client for browsing Reddit, allowing the user to read data from posts, view discussion threads, and search posts within the feed.

In order to make this project my own, I populated my feed with content from some of my favorite cat related subreddits.

Additional features implemented include:

- Ability to toggle subreddit visibility in the sidebar
- Displays certain addition post and discussion metadata
- Optimized rendering with subsections of the total feed, by page of 20 posts
- CI/CD and Web Hosting with Netlify

## Changelog:

### Version 0, 01/30/2022

First project build!

Many features still need to be built out, but much of the initial functionality exists, including:

- Post rendering
- Media rendering
- Discussion thread rendering
- UI design
